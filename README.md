## Examples in Spark In Action

These examples are copied / adapted from the original author 
Jean Georges Perrin's repository (https://github.com/jgperrin). 
All credits go to the author and all errors blame on me.

This repo exclusively contains examples in Scala. There is only a Java exclusive one out there.
 It contains some modification in terms of reducing verbosity and fixing deprecations.

Some examples are still in need to work, like chapter 11 where it is expected to implement a custom data format reader.
